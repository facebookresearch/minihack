# Unsupervised Environment Design

MiniHack also enables research in *Unsupervised Environment Design* (UED), whereby an adaptive task distribution is learned during training by dynamically adjusting free parameters of the task MDP.
MiniHack allows overriding the description file of the environment, making it easy to adjust the MDP configuration as required by UED.

In order to replicate the results of our *Unsupervised Experiment Design* experiments using the [PAIRED](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02096) algorithm, check the instruction [here](https://github.com/ucl-dark/paired).
