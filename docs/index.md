# MiniHack

![](imgs/minihack_envs.png)

MiniHack is a sandbox framework for easily designing rich and diverse environments for Reinforcement Learning (RL).
Based on the game of [NetHack](./about/nethack), arguably the hardest grid-based game in the world, MiniHack uses the [NetHack Learning Environment (NLE)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle) to provide a convenient [Gym interface](https://github.com/openai/gym) for customly created RL testbeds.

MiniHack already comes with a large list of challenging tasks.
However, it is primarily built for easily designing new ones.
The motivation behind MiniHack is to be able to perform RL
experiments in a controlled setting while being able to increasingly
scale the complexity of the tasks.

To this end, MiniHack leverages the [description files](./getting-started/des_files) of NetHack. The description files (or des-files) are human-readable specifications of levels: distributions of grid layouts together with monsters, objects on the floor, environment features (e.g. walls, water, lava), etc. The developers of NetHack created a special domain-specific language for describing the levels of the game, called _des-file format_. The des-files can be compiled into binary using the NetHack level compiler, and MiniHack maps them to [Gym environments](https://github.com/openai/gym).
